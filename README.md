# ReactGame
Extension of React's formal tutorial of a tic-tac-toe game.
Additional features include:
1. Location for each move in the format (col, row) is displayed in the move history list.
2. The currently selected item in the move list is bolded.
3. Board is rewritten to use two loops to dynamically construct the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. A toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order is added.
5. When someone wins, the three squares that caused the win are highlighted in pink.
6. When no one wins, a message about the result being a draw is displayed.
